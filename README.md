# Analysis of ML Modeling IMDb movie data in AutoML 
![autoMLimage](images/automl_image.png)

# What is AutoML?
* When users lack a comparative view of the output metrics generated by multiple machine learning (ML) models, it is hard for them to derive insights from datasets. Generating ML models also requires iterative processes that range from interpretation of the data to tuning of model parameters.


* AutoML implements functions and storage capability that can accelerate the development of ML models. The selection of ML modeling, the modeling process itself, the user’s input, and the ML modeling output are all automated. Users can compare the output metrics generated by various ML models in a single summary view. Output metrics help users determine which models would be the least or most successful in a given business scenario.

# AutoML
* An ML project requires iterative processes that range from interpretation of data to tuning of model parameters performed for the sake of developing an optimal model for the data. But some of these analytical tasks can be automated, and AutoML implements functions that accelerate development of the ML model.

# Output view and metrics
* Users can review the CSV files that they have uploaded in a summary view.
* Quality columns show what the input data looks like.
* After ML modeling, area under the curve (AUC), precision, recall, and accuracy values are displayed.
* For Spark in Local, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is generated in a histogram by clicking the ML model names, enabling users to determine which category values most impact the target value in the ML modeling. SHAP is a method of explaining individual predictions. A positive SHAP value means a positive impact on prediction. In AutoML, SHAP values are converted to absolute values and displayed in a histogram.

# User's profile
* Our target users are users who want to analyze data and to have the results represented in multiple ML models.
* To run the AutoML application, users download required libraries and run Python modules (see the  `Install on your mac` section).


# Data sources
The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an online database about films, television series, home videos, video games, and online streaming content. The information includes names of cast members and production crew members and biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and reviews by critics and fans. The earliest date of a listed movie or TV show is 1888; the latest date for a listed production, 2024, is for productions that will be completed or released in that year. IMDb is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.

###
* You can find IMDb dataset definitions at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
* You can download IMDb files from https://datasets.imdbws.com/
For AutoML, title.basics.tsv.gz and title.ratings.tsv.gz are applied, then joined and modified in R for the AutoML input.

###
For AutoML testing, movies from the movie dataset are filtered by `titleType` and `startYear` between 2010 and 2020. The rating dataset is used as is.
Each `primaryTitle` is categorized as one or more genres. New columns such as rateHighLow, voteHighLow, and rateGreaterThan8 are added as target variables for the AutoML prediction.
* rateHighLow: set at 1 if the rate is greater than or equal to the average rate; set at 0 if the rate is lower than the average rate.
* voteHighLow: set at 1 if the number of votes is greater than or equal to the average number; set at 0 if the number of votes is lower than the average number.
* rateGreaterThan8: set at 1 if the rate is greater than or equal to the average rate of 8.0 (the scale is 1.0 to 10.0); set at 0 if the rate is lower than the average rate of 8.0.

```

# How the dataset is applied in AutoML
Any comma-separated value (CSV) files can be uploaded to AutoML. A sample dataset is prepared and stored as sample/imdb_movie_rating_2010_2022.csv.
A user’s uploaded files are stored in the data folder as 1.csv, 2.csv, and so on in Spark in local.


# Variables for ML modeling
### Target variables
* The variable that AutoML recommends from a list of prospects is the target (predictor) variable selected for ML modeling.

### Category variables
* By default, AutoML detects variables that cannot be used for ML modeling because they are nonnumerical expressions.
* In addition to default detection, the user's selected variables in `Category Variables` should be assigned numerical expressions of 1 or 0, and one of them is dropped by the get_dummies function with drop_first = True.
<img src = "images/automl_data_clearning_for_category_variables.png" width="800">

### Unused variables 
* By default, AutoML identifies variables that are inappropriate for use in ML modeling, such as those with an excessive number of missing values, too many unique values, and so on. In addition to carrying out default detection, users are required to select more unused variables on the basis of their decisions.

### Variables in evaluation metrics
TP: True Positive, TN: True Negative, FP: False Positive, and FN: False Negative
* AUC score: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) = FPR*chi + TPR (if AUC score is below 0.5, the prediction output can not be trusted) 
* Precision score: TP/(TP+FP)
* Recall(Sensitivity) score: TP/(TP+FN)
* Accuracy score: (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

# AutoML features
* Select sample/imdb_movie_rating_2010_2022.csv from user's local folder through `Choose File` button and click `Import a new dataset`. 
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/automl_manage_dataset.png" width="800" hight="200">
</p>

* AutoML registers the dataset that the user has uploaded and displays string-type as default in `Category Variables`; it also displays string-type as default in `Unused Variables for Modeling` if the value contains too many unique variables.
<p align="center">
